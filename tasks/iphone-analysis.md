# iPhone App Conversion Analysis
## Myra Language Teacher → iOS App

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Analyst:** Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6)
**Scope:** Minimum changes to convert this web app to a publishable iPhone app

---

## Executive Summary

The backend requires **zero changes**. CORS is already configured (`allow_origins=["*"]`), and the FastAPI server on GCP Cloud Run already handles all the heavy computation (Whisper STT, gTTS TTS, fuzzy matching).

The recommended path to the App Store is **Capacitor** in remote-server mode: a thin native iOS shell that loads the existing web UI from the Cloud Run URL. This requires creating **2 new files** and running Xcode on a Mac.

### Minimum change count
| Layer | Files Changed | Lines Changed |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Backend | 0 | 0 |
| Frontend JS/CSS/HTML | 0 | 0 |
| New config files | 2 | ~30 |
| iOS project (generated) | auto-generated by Capacitor | — |

---

## 1. Current Architecture Analysis

### What the web app consists of

```
Browser (any device)
       │ HTTP
       ▼
GCP Cloud Run ──► FastAPI (main.py, port 8000)
       │                 │
       │          ┌──────┼──────────┐
       │          │      │          │
       │       Whisper  gTTS    rapidfuzz
       │        (STT)  (TTS)   (matching)
       │
       └── Serves HTML/CSS/JS via Jinja2
```

### Key observations from code review

1. **CORS is already wide open** (`main.py:21-26`):
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["*"],
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```
   A Capacitor app calling the API from a native shell will succeed without any changes.

2. **Jinja2 usage is minimal** — only one server-side variable:
   ```html
   <!-- index.html:20 -->
   <h1 id="child-name-title">🦕 {{ config.child_name }} Learns!</h1>
   ```
   JavaScript immediately overwrites this from `localStorage` on page load, so this is cosmetic only.

3. **All API calls are relative** (`/api/word`, `/api/tts`, etc.) — these resolve correctly when the web content is loaded from the Cloud Run URL in a remote-server Capacitor configuration.

4. **MediaRecorder has iOS fallback logic already**:
   ```javascript
   // app.js — already handles codec detection
   const options = MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('audio/webm;codecs=opus')
     ? { mimeType: 'audio/webm;codecs=opus' }
     : {}
   mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, options)
   ```
   On iOS, this falls back to `audio/mp4` which is supported in WKWebView (Capacitor's iOS webview) from iOS 14.3+.

5. **Web Audio API SFX** — all synthesized, no audio files. iOS requires a user-gesture before AudioContext can start, but all SFX is already triggered by button taps (user gestures), so this works as-is.

6. **TTS audio playback** — the app plays `<Audio>` objects created from API URL streams. iOS requires user-gesture before autoplay, but all TTS is triggered by user actions (play button, record button). This is compliant.

---

## 2. iOS Compatibility Assessment

| Feature | Web API Used | iOS WKWebView Support | Action Required |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Microphone access | `getUserMedia` | ✅ iOS 14.3+ | Add `Info.plist` key |
| Audio recording | `MediaRecorder` | ✅ iOS 14.3+ (mp4) | None (fallback exists) |
| Audio playback (TTS) | `<Audio>` element | ✅ | None |
| Web Audio SFX | `AudioContext` | ✅ (user gesture required) | None (already triggered by button) |
| Fetch API | `fetch()` | ✅ | None |
| LocalStorage | `localStorage` | ✅ | None |
| CSS animations | CSS3 | ✅ | None |
| SVG animations | SVG + CSS | ✅ | None |
| Responsive layout | CSS flexbox | ✅ | None |
| Confetti (DOM particles) | DOM + CSS | ✅ | None |

**Conclusion:** The existing web app is already largely iOS-compatible. The only required change is declaring microphone permission in the iOS project's `Info.plist`.

---

## 3. Approach Options

### Option A: Capacitor (Remote Server Mode) — RECOMMENDED

**What it is:** Capacitor wraps the existing web app in a native iOS WKWebView shell. In remote-server mode, the WKWebView loads the app directly from the Cloud Run URL — exactly like a browser, but without browser chrome and with a native app icon.

**Changes required:**
- Create `package.json` (1 new file, ~15 lines)
- Create `capacitor.config.ts` (1 new file, ~15 lines)
- On a Mac: `npx cap add ios` generates the iOS project
- Add microphone permission string to `ios/App/App/Info.plist`
- Add app icons + launch screen in Xcode

**Pros:**
- Backend: zero changes
- Frontend: zero changes
- Familiar web development workflow
- Fast iteration (change backend → see it in app immediately)
- Native microphone permission prompts handled automatically

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connection (app loads from server)
- Apple occasionally rejects "web wrapper" apps — mitigated by having genuine native hardware use (microphone)
- Requires macOS + Xcode for final build + submission

---

### Option B: PWA (Progressive Web App)

**What it is:** Add a web app manifest and service worker so iPhone users can "Add to Home Screen" via Safari, getting an app-like experience.

**Changes required:**
- `static/manifest.json` (new, ~25 lines)
- `static/js/sw.js` service worker (new, ~40 lines)
- 3 meta tags in `index.html`
- Route to serve `/manifest.json` in `main.py`

**Pros:**
- Zero native tooling required
- Works immediately

**Cons:**
- Cannot be published to the App Store
- Safari PWA limitations: no background processing, limited push notifications
- MediaRecorder on iOS Safari (outside WKWebView) has more restrictions than in Capacitor
- Users must know to "Add to Home Screen" — less discoverable

---

### Option C: React Native / Swift Native

**What it is:** Full frontend rewrite in Swift (SwiftUI) or React Native, calling the same backend API.

**Changes required:** Complete frontend rewrite (~1000+ lines new code)

**Pros:**
- Best native performance and feel
- Full access to all native iOS APIs
- No App Store rejection risk for web wrapper

**Cons:**
- Not "minimum changes" — this is a full rewrite
- Requires Swift/React Native expertise
- Backend stays the same but frontend is entirely new

---

## 4. Recommended Implementation: Capacitor Remote Server

### Prerequisites (one-time setup)
- macOS computer (required for Xcode)
- Xcode installed (free from Mac App Store) — requires macOS 14+
- Node.js 18+ installed (`brew install node`)
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year at developer.apple.com)
- The app deployed to Cloud Run at a stable URL

### Step 1: Create `package.json`

Create this file at the project root:

```json
{
  "name": "myra-language-teacher",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Toddler language learning app for Myra",
  "scripts": {
    "cap:sync": "npx cap sync",
    "cap:ios": "npx cap open ios",
    "cap:build": "npx cap sync ios"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/core": "^6.0.0",
    "@capacitor/ios": "^6.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@capacitor/cli": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create `capacitor.config.ts`

```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  // Must match the Bundle ID you register in App Store Connect
  appId: 'com.myra.languageteacher',
  appName: 'Myra Learns!',

  // This tells Capacitor to load from the remote server,
  // not from local static files. ALL existing relative API
  // calls (/api/word, /api/tts, etc.) continue to work.
  server: {
    url: 'https://YOUR-CLOUD-RUN-URL.run.app',
    cleartext: false,
  },

  // iOS-specific settings
  ios: {
    // Allows the WKWebView to access the microphone
    // (the actual permission string goes in Info.plist)
    backgroundColor: '#FFE4F0',
  },
};

export default config;
```

**Replace `YOUR-CLOUD-RUN-URL`** with the actual Cloud Run service URL from:
```bash
cd infra && terraform output service_url
# or
gcloud run services describe dino-app --region=us-central1 --format='value(status.url)'
```

### Step 3: Install Capacitor and initialize iOS project (on Mac)

Run these commands at the project root:

```bash
# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Initialize Capacitor with the iOS platform
npx cap add ios

# Sync (copies config to iOS project)
npx cap sync
```

This generates an `ios/` directory containing the full Xcode project.

### Step 4: Add microphone permission to `Info.plist`

Open `ios/App/App/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Myra Learns uses the microphone so you can practice saying words out loud and check your pronunciation.</string>
```

This message is shown to the user when iOS prompts for microphone access.

### Step 5: Open in Xcode and configure

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

In Xcode:

1. **Set signing team**: Click the `App` project in the navigator → Signing & Capabilities → select your Apple Developer Team
2. **Verify Bundle ID**: Should be `com.myra.languageteacher` (must be unique across all App Store apps — check App Store Connect)
3. **Set version**: General → Version: `1.0.0`, Build: `1`
4. **Set deployment target**: iOS 14.3 minimum (required for MediaRecorder support)

### Step 6: Add app icons

The App Store requires a 1024×1024 PNG app icon (no transparency, no rounded corners — Apple rounds them automatically).

Design options:
- Use the pink dino from the web app (export the SVG as a PNG)
- Use a service like [appicon.co](https://www.appicon.co) to generate all required sizes from the 1024×1024 source
- In Xcode: navigate to `App → Assets.xcassets → AppIcon` and drag in the generated images

Minimum required sizes for iOS:
| Size | Usage |
|------|-------|
| 20×20 @2x, @3x | Notifications |
| 29×29 @2x, @3x | Settings |
| 40×40 @2x, @3x | Spotlight |
| 60×60 @2x, @3x | Home screen iPhone |
| 1024×1024 @1x | App Store |

### Step 7: Test on a real iPhone

Connect iPhone via USB cable.

In Xcode:
1. Select your device from the scheme menu (top left dropdown)
2. Press Run (▶️)
3. On first run, go to iPhone Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → trust your developer certificate

Test the full flow:
- [ ] App opens and loads the web UI from Cloud Run
- [ ] Settings page works, name saves
- [ ] Word cards display correctly
- [ ] "Hear It!" plays TTS audio
- [ ] "Say It!" prompts for microphone permission, then records
- [ ] Recording is sent to server and result displayed
- [ ] Correct/wrong feedback animations work
- [ ] Confetti and sounds play on correct answer

### Step 8: Add a Launch Screen (required for App Store)

Xcode auto-generates a basic launch screen. To customize:
1. In Xcode: `App → LaunchScreen.storyboard`
2. Set background color to match the app's gradient (`#FFE4F0`)
3. Optionally add the dino logo

## 5. App Store Publishing Steps

### 5.1 Create App Store Connect listing

1. Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Sign in with your Apple Developer account
3. Click **My Apps** → **+** → **New App**
4. Fill in:
   - **Platform**: iOS
   - **Name**: `Myra Learns!` (max 30 chars, must be unique)
   - **Primary language**: English
   - **Bundle ID**: `com.myra.languageteacher` (must match Xcode exactly)
   - **SKU**: `myra-language-teacher-001` (internal identifier, not shown publicly)
5. Click **Create**

### 5.2 Fill in app metadata

In App Store Connect under the new app → App Store tab:

**App Information:**
- **Subtitle**: Teach Telugu & Assamese with Roo (max 30 chars)
- **Category**: Primary: Education; Secondary: Kids Games
- **Content Rights**: Confirm you own all content

**Privacy Policy:**
A privacy policy URL is **required** for all apps that collect user data. Since this app:
- Uses a microphone (records audio)
- Sends audio to a server (Google gTTS calls)
- Stores user config locally

You need a privacy policy. Use a free generator like [privacypolicygenerator.info](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info) or host a simple markdown file on GitHub Pages. Example content to include:
- What data is collected (audio recordings processed in real-time, not stored)
- That audio is sent to Google gTTS for text-to-speech
- That no personal data is retained
- Contact information

**Age Rating:**
- Go to Age Rating tab → Answer the questionnaire
- This app: No violence, no adult content → will receive **4+** rating

**Pricing:**
- Set to **Free** (recommended for a family app)

### 5.3 Prepare screenshots

App Store Connect requires screenshots for at least these sizes:
| Device | Screen Size |
|--------|------------|
| iPhone 6.7" | 1290×2796 px |
| iPhone 6.5" | 1242×2688 px (or 1284×2778) |
| iPhone 5.5" | 1242×2208 px |

Take screenshots on a real device or use the Xcode Simulator:
- Open Simulator → select iPhone model → run app → take screenshot (Cmd+S)
- Recommended screens to capture:
  1. Word card with dino in idle state (main teaching screen)
  2. Recording state with countdown timer
  3. Correct answer with confetti/celebration
  4. Settings page

### 5.4 Archive and upload the build

In Xcode:

1. Select **Any iOS Device** (not a simulator) as the build target
2. Menu: **Product → Archive**
3. Wait for archiving to complete
4. The **Organizer** window opens automatically
5. Select your archive → **Distribute App**
6. Choose **App Store Connect** → **Upload**
7. Follow the prompts (accept defaults for most options)
8. Click **Upload**

Processing takes 5–15 minutes. You'll get an email when the build is ready.

### 5.5 Submit for Review

Back in App Store Connect:

1. Under **App Store** → select your version (e.g., 1.0)
2. Scroll to **Build** section → click **+** → select the uploaded build
3. Fill in **What's New in This Version**: `First release — Myra Learns Telugu and Assamese with Roo the dino!`
4. Add a **Demo Account** if needed (this app has no login, so write "No account required")
5. **Review Notes**: Explain the microphone usage: *"This educational app for toddlers uses the microphone to practice pronunciation. The child says a word, and the app checks whether it was said correctly. Audio is sent to our server for speech recognition only and is not stored."*
6. Click **Add for Review**
7. Answer the export compliance question (No encryption → click No)
8. Click **Submit to App Review**

### 5.6 App Review process

- **Typical wait time**: 24–48 hours for first submission, faster for updates
- **Common rejection reasons for this type of app:**
  1. Missing privacy policy URL → fix by adding privacy policy
  2. Microphone not working in reviewer's test environment → add review notes explaining the flow
  3. Crashes on launch → test thoroughly on device before submitting
  4. "Web wrapper" rejection → respond in Resolution Center explaining the native microphone integration

- **If rejected**: Read the rejection reason in App Store Connect → Resolution Center. Reply with explanation or fix and resubmit. You can resubmit unlimited times.

### 5.7 After approval

- The app goes live on the App Store within a few hours of approval
- Share the App Store link with family
- Users find it by searching "Myra Learns" or via your direct link
- To update the app: increment the build number in Xcode, archive again, upload, submit for review

---

## 6. Children's App Compliance (CRITICAL)

Because this app is designed for a child under 13, Apple may place it in the **Kids category**. If you choose the Kids category (or if Apple moves it there), these rules apply:

### Kids Category Rules
- **No third-party analytics** — remove any tracking SDKs (there are none currently — good)
- **No behavioral advertising** — not applicable (no ads)
- **No external links** — the Settings page has no external links ✅
- **No social networking** — not applicable ✅
- **Parental gate required** for in-app purchases or links to external websites — not applicable ✅
- **Privacy policy required** — must cover data practices

### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
Since the app is used by a child under 13 and sends audio to a server:
- Audio recordings are processed in real-time and **not stored** — document this in your privacy policy
- Google gTTS receives text (word translations) to generate audio — disclose this
- No personal information is collected or retained

**Recommendation:** Place the app in the **Education** category (not Kids category) to avoid the strictest Kids rules, but still comply with COPPA principles in your privacy policy.

## 7. Potential Issues and Mitigations

### Issue 1: Apple "web wrapper" rejection
**Risk:** Apple may reject the app if reviewers decide it's "simply a wrapper around a website."

**Mitigation:**
- In Review Notes, emphasize: *"This app uses native iOS microphone access for real-time speech recognition to check children's pronunciation. The core functionality (record audio → send to server → get feedback → animate dino) cannot be achieved with a simple browser bookmark."*
- The microphone use distinguishes this from a pure web wrapper
- Many successful App Store apps use WKWebView with a backend

### Issue 2: MediaRecorder audio format on iOS
**Risk:** `audio/webm;codecs=opus` is not supported in WKWebView on iOS.

**Status:** Already handled. The app's codec detection falls back to the system default (`audio/mp4`) when WebM is unavailable. The backend's pydub/ffmpeg pipeline handles `audio/mp4` input.

**Verify:** After installing on iPhone, test the "Say It!" feature and check that the backend logs show `audio/mp4` being received and processed successfully.

### Issue 3: App requires internet (no offline mode)
**Risk:** No internet = no app functionality.

**Impact:** Low — this is a teaching app for home use where WiFi is available.

**If needed later:** Add a service worker + local caching of word data and pre-generated TTS audio. This is not required for initial launch.

### Issue 4: Cold start delay (Cloud Run scales to zero)
**Risk:** If the Cloud Run instance has scaled to zero, the first user action after a long idle period may take 10–30 seconds.

**Status:** The Whisper model is pre-loaded in the Docker image (baked in during build), so this is primarily network cold start, not model loading.

**Mitigation options:**
- Set `min_instance_count = 1` in `infra/cloud_run.tf` (increases cost ~$20/month)
- Show a loading spinner while waiting for the server to respond
- Accept the cold start (family use case — happens rarely)

### Issue 5: gTTS requires internet on the server
**Risk:** If Google's TTS service is unreachable, "Hear It!" and voice prompts fail silently.

**Status:** Not an iOS-specific issue — same risk on web.

---

## 8. PWA Alternative (No App Store)

If you want Myra to use the app on her iPhone **without going through the App Store**, a PWA ("Add to Home Screen") is faster to set up.

### What to add

**1. Serve a web manifest** — add to `main.py`:
```python
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

@app.get("/manifest.json")
async def manifest():
    return FileResponse("static/manifest.json", media_type="application/manifest+json")
```

**2. Create `static/manifest.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "Myra Learns!",
  "short_name": "Myra Learns",
  "description": "Learn Telugu and Assamese with Roo the dino",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#FFE4F0",
  "theme_color": "#FF69B4",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/static/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/static/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/static/icons/icon-1024.png",
      "sizes": "1024x1024",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. Add meta tags to `templates/index.html`** (inside `<head>`):
```html
<!-- PWA / iOS home screen support -->
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="default" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Myra Learns!" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/static/icons/icon-192.png" />
```

**4. Create icons** (192×192, 512×512, 1024×1024 PNG) of the dino and place in `static/icons/`.

### How to install on iPhone
1. Open Safari on iPhone
2. Navigate to `https://your-cloud-run-url.run.app`
3. Tap the Share button (box with arrow pointing up)
4. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
5. Tap "Add"

The app now appears on the home screen with a full-screen experience (no Safari address bar), working exactly like an app.

**Limitation:** PWAs are not discoverable via the App Store. This is fine for personal/family use but not for public distribution.
